I am going to build a simple chat using Wolframalpha's conversational API. This simple app will allow you to ask random questions, get a response, and then follow up with a related question or ask a new question.

This will require two fetch requests, Two GETs with text term. The first will be a simple initial request. The second will require modifying the fetch using information provided in the first GET in order to get intelligent follow up

This will involve using fetch, objects, and array functions to store and use returned information and display it.
